# Intelligent-Virtual-Assistant

There are millions of people who are visually impaired. Researches shows that people with
visual impairments are less likely to access the internet then people without disabilities. They
deserve a fair chance to utilize the technology. Searching information about anything is difficult
for them since they cannot finger type the question. The main agenda of this project is to solve
this problem. The solution is to build a voice assistant for desktop.

Objectives
• Main objective of building desktop voice assistant is to answer the questions that user may
ask.
• Another objective is voice assistant can save time. In fact, voice is reputed to be four times
faster than the written search.
• Fundamental objectives that maximize users’ overall value of using voice assistants, are
efficiency and convenience.
• Design a user-friendly application to access anywhere at any given time.
• Ease of use, minimal cognitive effort, and enjoyment are also the other objectives.
• Automating repeated tasks to a voice-activated personal assistant frees up the human time
and resources.
• It can efficiently perform these mundane tasks with no errors, which often leads to an
improvement in customer satisfaction.

Societal Applications
• This application has implications for the society, especially those with limitations in
eyesight can be so much more productive and independent.
• This software can improve the library accessibility to the blind and visually challenged
community.
• This project is feasible for future updates which can have greater impact on community.
• Voice assistant reduces time as voice search is four times faster than finger type search.
• It provides the services whenever needed and is very user friendly.
• It also saves the time by automating repetitive tasks.

Intelligent Virtual Assistant
• While voice assistants are left to deal with routine tasks, humans can dedicate more time to
duties where human intervention is required for many number of successful business
solutions and services.
• Even with emerging innovations and deep learning, these talking assistants never stop
working.
• They are continually accessing reports, analyzing data, and ensuring critical systems are
updated.
